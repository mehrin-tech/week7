1)Database- is a structured system that stores that large  amount of informations.so we can easily add ,find,update,delete.
school db create:-
Database=>school
collections=>classes
documents=>each student rcrds
fields=>name,marks,course

2)Database Managmnet Systm(DBMS):-
is a software  its helps us to store  organize,manage,and acess data for easily.
*its acts as a bridge btw user and Database.allowng usto create,read,update,and delete data efficiently

DBMS -it acts like a librarian  of school library.
3)SQL vs NoSQL
i)SQL (relational Database):-
   *it has fixed schema  means structre like table with rows and columns.
   schema must be defined before inserting.
   *use SQL to manage and query data
   *best for structured and consistent data
   *provide high data accuracy and follow strict rules
   eg:-MySQL,PostgreSQL,oracle 
   eg:- Table students
   id | name | course | marks 
  ==============================
    0 | asha | BSc  |80


ii)NoSQL(non-relational db):-
   * store data flexible  format  such as a documents,key-value pair ,graphs
   *its have no fixed schema -so we can change anytime  the data structure.
   *use diffrnt query methds not only sql.
   *its bst for unstructred,semi-structred or fast -charging data.
   *desgned for high scalability & performance.
   eg:-MongoDB,Cassendra,firebase

4)functions of DBMS:-
i)create 
ii)read
iii)update
iv)delete
v)secure


5)======MongoDB=======
*is a populr NoSQL db that stores data in a flexible,JSON-like format  called documents 
instd of tables and rows likes SQL the traditional DB.
*it organizes documents inside  collections,making it easy to store ,acess and manage large amount of structured ,semi-structured or unstructured data.
* it is a documnt orientd highly scalable and works perfectly with js&nodejs,which makes its widely used for modern web apps such as social media,e-commerce & chatsapp.

eg in data store like this in mongoDB:-
{name:'asha',
age:20,
course:'scirnce'
sub:['maths,phy],
address:{city:'dubai",pin:12345}
}

======features and Advntges of MongoDB===========
*docmnt orientd-it stores data as documnts like BSon/JSON
*flexible schema
*scalable-it can handle large data & grow easily across multipl servers.
*high performance-so it fast reads and writes.
*integrtn  with  js:-
it uses JSOn like syntax,it works on perfectly with backed and frontend apps.
*powerful querying and aggregtion(filter,sort,grp)


structure :-
School (db)
|____Collectns  (std)
|    |___Docmnt1:{name:'hanah',course:'BSC"}
|     |___Docmnt2:{name:'asha",couse:'BCA}
|
|
|_____collection (techr)     
      |__doc1:
      |___doc2

====key commands====
show dbs=>list all db first(admin,locl..)
use  School=>create/switchd to school DB.  show Db=>db enter
db.createCollections("students")=>create collections
show colllections=>show all collections
db.dropDatabase()=>delete DB

I)each collctn is stord as multiple BSON files under MongoDB's data directry.


====data types in mongo====
string
number
boolean
array-multiple values in one field
object-nstd strctr
Date-stored as ISO date in BSON
objectId
deciaml128-high precision decmal


Q)BSON                VS                       JSON
*Binry formt                               text-basd
*supprts rich types(date,objId)             limitd data types
*optimised for speed & efficncy             human readable
*faster for Db engines                       slower to parse


=====Insert operations===========

1)insertOne()
eg:-db.students.insertOne({name:'aisha',age:20})
2)insertMany()
eg:-
db.students.insertMany([
    {name:'aisha',age:20,address:{city:"thrisur"},sub:["maths"]},
    {name:'rana',age:22,address:{city:"palakkd"},sub:["eng"]},
    {name:'hana',age:23,address:{city:"malappram"},sub:["phy"]}
])

======retrieve data===========

1)find()

2)findOne()
db.students.findOne()->res={name:'asha',age:20,address:{city:"thrisur"},sub:["maths"]}
3)find().pretty()
db.students.find().pretty()=>
{name:'asha',
age:20,
address:{city:"thrisur"},
sub:["maths"]}
4)find({find:value})
db.students.find({name:'rana'}) res=
 {name:'rana',age:22,address:{city:"palakkd"},sub:["eng"]},
